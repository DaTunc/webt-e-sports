            <h3>Number 10: Call of Duty WWII</h3>
            <p>Prize Pool: $4.17M</p>
            <p>
                As is tradition, Activision’s  Call of Duty: WWII  had its one year in the esports spotlight before being replaced by the next entry, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4.
                WWII was the for the Call of Duty World League’s 2019 season, and while the historical shooter wasn’t considered a series favorite by many pro players, it still provided the battleground for more than $4M pricepool in 2019.
            </p>
            <h3>Number 9: StarCraft II</h3>
            <p>Prize Pool: $4.53M</p>
            <p>            
                It’s the oldest of Blizzard Entertainment’s games on this list, but real-time strategy smash StarCraft II  still awarded more than $4.5M in 2018. In total, there were 12 tournaments with at least $100K up for grabs, and it was Blizzard’s own StarCraft II World Championship Series finals at BlizzCon that topped the list with a $1.4M prize pool. There are bigger esports today, even in Blizzard’s own stable, but StarCraft II continues to thrive.
            </p>
            <h3>Number 8: Hearthstone</h3>
            <p>Prize Pool: $6.52M</p>
            <p>
                Blizzard’s competitive card game saw an increase in prizing in 2019, with January’s official Hearthstone World Championship 2017 making the biggest impact with its $1M prize pool. That said, 2018 also saw five other tournaments or season splits with prize pools above $500K, while 2017’s largest Hearthstone event topped out at $332K.
            </p>
            <h3>Number 6: Overwatch</h3>
            <p> Prize Pool: $6.7M</p>
            <p>
                With the launch of the Overwatch League, Blizzard’s Overwatch nearly doubled its 2019 prizing ($3.56M). The OWL itself accounted for $3.5M of that, with just over $2.1M awarded in the lower-tier Overwatch Contenders league. OWL attracted plenty of hype in 2019, but with a league structure that mimics traditional sports and lacks a typical World Championship tournament like in other esports, the total prize pool fell well short of this year’s top four. Next season’s $5M OWL prize pool could nudge it higher up the list, however.
            </p>
            <h3>Number 5: PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds</h3>
            <p>Prize Pool: $6.73M</p>
            <p>
                PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds  (PUBG) maker PUBG Corporation got serious about esports in 2018, with the battle royale shooter blowing past the $1.01M tally from 2017. July’s PUBG Global Invitational 2018 topped the list with $2M in total prizing, with another $586K doled out during qualifiers.
            </p>
            <h3>Number 4: League of Legends</h3>
            <p>Prize Pool: $14.12M</p>
            <p>
                The difference between the top four and the rest of the list is staggering, with League of Legends  (LoL) awarding more than double the total prize pool of the previous game. LoL continued its upward ascent in 2018, with a $2M increase over 2017’s sum, and $6.45M of the year’s total coming from the recent LoL World Championship. Of course, those tallies pale in comparison to another MOBA coming later on this list.
            </p>
            <h3>Number 3: Fortnite</h3>
            <p>Prize Pool: $19.96M</p>
            <p>
                Epic Games  committed $100M to Fortnite  prize pools during the 2018-19 season, and we saw nearly $20M of that come through by the end of 2018. Fortnite was inescapable this year, with streamers and celebrities helping to catapult the free-to-play battle royale hit into the mainstream consciousness, and Epic spent the back half of the year experimenting with big-money tournaments and competitive formats. If the publisher’s prize pool funding goal carries through, then 2019’s tally will increase at least fourfold.
            </p>
            <h3>Number 2:Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</h3>
            <p>Prize Pool: $22.47M</p>
            <p>
                This year saw no shortage of significant Counter-Strike: Global Offensive  (CS:GO) tournaments, with Esports Earnings tracking 370 of them, large and small. On the top end, the World Electronic Sports Games (WESG) 2017 awarded $1.67M total between men’s and women’s tournaments, plus there were six more events with prize pools at or just above the $1M mark. CS:GO has seen an annual prize pool increase of about $3M for two straight years now.
            </p>
            <h3>Number 1:Dota 2</h3>
            <p>Prize Pool: $41.26M</p>
            <p>
                No surprise here: Dota 2  has awarded the most all-time prize money to date, with each year’s The International tournament (the de facto world championship) topping the previous year’s pool via crowdfunding. In 2018, that single-event prize pool was a staggering $25.5M, but there were also nine other tournaments with a prize pool of at least $1M. Dota 2 has long been the annual leader, although Epic’s promised Fortnite prize pool push could see that game take over the list in 2019
