            for points in the other events to come into the choosing bracket of four where they will play against the other teams to come into the K.O. Phase where they play best of three. And in the finals they play a best of five. It is tradition to play silver scrapes if it
            comes to a fifth game. The song is well known under the basic players of league and it will always be an intense fight if the song comes up when the best of the best compete for the title. Sadly tho there is no reason to play silver scrapes due to the fact that
            one region will always dominate the ohter. But it is always a pleasure to see the teams on the big stage with a grand opening and their skills on the big screen.

        <article>
            The LCS is the north amarican tournement for League of Legends teams. But unlike the LEC or LSK the LCS is probably one of the most underrated and possible biggest dissapointments for north americans duo to their bad raputation in League of Legends. Sadly these are not rumours.
            The most of the time the LCS winners are often the last or second last chance for north american. Even tho they have a bad reputation and even if they are not the best in the world, they still give a hell of a fight before going down.
